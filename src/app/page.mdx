# Juliette Lamarche, Full-stack developer

Hi! it's Juliette! I'm a **bilingual** (French/English) **full-stack** developer from **Montreal**. My dad thougth me Pascal when I was a teen, and I have been an avid **self-learner** ever since. I have graduated both in **mathematics** and humanities. 


I understand code as a form of communication. I see technical problems in their social contexts. I have a fascination for knowledge management. I balance a taste for autonomy with a love of teamwork. When I am not coding, I organise community art projects as a visual artist. I also write poetry. I thrive in intellectual challenge.


My main languages are **TypeScript**, **Go** and **Lua**. I also know some C/C++, Haskell and Bash. I have in-depth knowdledge of **React** and some experience with **React Native**. I've been using **Linux** for 20 years. I like to apply **functional programing** patterns in a pragmatic way.


If you think we might be a good fit, please [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliette-lamarche-2295a4248/)!
