# Juliette Lamarche, Full-stack developer

Hi! It's Juliette! I'm a **bilingual** (French/English) **full-stack** developer from **Montreal**. My dad taught me Pascal when I was a teen, and I have been an avid **self-learner** ever since. I have graduated both in **mathematics** and **humanities**. 


I understand code as a form of communication. I see technical problems in their social context. I have a fascination for knowledge management. I balance a taste for autonomy with a love of teamwork. When I am not coding, I organize community art projects as a visual artist. I also write poetry. I thrive in intellectual challenge.


My main languages are **TypeScript**, **Go** and **Lua**. I also know some C/C++, Haskell and Bash. I have in-depth knowledge of **React** and some experience with **React Native**. I've been using **Linux** for 20 years. I like to apply **functional programming** patterns in a pragmatic way.


If you think we might be a good fit, please [reach out](mailto:juliette.lamarche.xyz@gmail.com)!
