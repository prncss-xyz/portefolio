# Juliette Lamarche, Full-stack developer

Hi! It's Juliette! I'm a **bilingual** (French/English) **full-stack** developer from **Montreal**. My main technologies are **TypeScript**, **React**, **React Native**, **Node**, **Next** and **Golang**.

I am a self-taught fullstack developer with a formal training in mathematics and linguistics. A wide range of interests lead me to various tech (programmer, analyst) and non-tech (trainer, communication officer) roles. I am also a poet and a painter.

As a former mathematician, I am fond of functional programming methodologies and try to make them palatable for non FP programmers as well. As a former analyst, I am sensitive to business perspectives, making sure technical solutions are also creating business value. Finally, poetry and linguistics are giving me insights on what makes a code easier to understand.
